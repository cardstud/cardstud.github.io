### Introduction
Hi, I'm Todd DiFronzo, a data scientist, with a focus on medical, gaming and sports analytics. My goal is to take the field of Data Science and apply it to those professional and lesiure interests, in order to create positive and real world changes, with the hopes that future enthusiasts can either benefit or expand on my contributions.

Much is made about "thinking outside the box" but I contend that we must first "think inside the box" correctly to build a solid foundation before moving outside. To do this, one must forgo the age-old memorization schooling and embrace the ideology of critical thinking. Knowing how something works is much more useful then remembering how something works.

### Background

 <ul>
 <li>BS Health Physics, graduated UNLV 2006</li>
 <li>Medical field background - prehospital care, 1992-2004; 2014-2016</li>
 <li>Softball - coaching/playing</li>
 <li>No professional DS experience, but is attending Lambda School to grow and hone skills in Data Science</li>
 </ul>

### Medical Field
I've spent over 15 years in pre-hospital care as an EMT-I, AEMT and Paramedic in the very busy, high call volume of Las Vegas. This background has put me in tough stressful situations that taught me to think clearly and quickly with patience and confidence. My goal was to create a positive impact on other fellow human beings lives and provide the best overall outcome for my patients. I believe Data Science can be weielded to achieve these same goals albeit in a different capacity.

### Health Physics
Health Physics is the applied physics of radiation protection for health and health care purposes. It is the science concerned with the recognition, evaluation and control of health hazards to permit the safe use and application of ionizing radiation

Health physics professionals promote excellence in the science and practice of radiation protection and safety.

### Sports
I've been playing softball and darts for over 25 years. These sports, both team and individual, have taught me the importance of practice, team work, determination, class and dignity. These are skills perfect for a career in Data Science.

Hi, I'm Todd DiFronzo, a future data scientist. My focus is on taking the field of Data Science and applying it to those interests in my life, both professional and leisure, to create positive and real life changes, with the hopes that future enthusiasts can benefit from.

Studying Health Phyiscs in both the undegrad and graduate settings have taught me to think, not just in the cliche sense of "outside the box", but "inside the box". Much learning is spent on memorizing while "in the box" but in my experience, real learning stems from not remembering how to do something, but from knowing how to do something.

### Medical Field
I've spent over 15 years in pre-hospital care as an EMT-I, AEMT and Paramedic in the very busy, high call volume of Las Vegas. This background has put me in tough stressful situations that taught me to think clearly and quickly with patience and confidence. My goal was to create a positive impact on other fellow human beings life and provide the best overall outcome for my patients. I believe Data Science can be weielded to achieve these same goals albeit in a different capacity.

### Sports
I've been playing softball and darts for over 25 years. These sports, both team and individual, have taught me the importance of practice, team work, determination, class and dignity. These are skills perfect for a career in Data Science.

Hi, I'm Todd DiFronzo, a future data scientist. My focus is on taking the field of Data Science and applying it to those interests in my life, both professional and leisure, to create positive and real life changes, with the hopes that future enthusiasts can benefit from.

Studying Health Phyiscs in both the undegrad and graduate settings have taught me to think, not just "outside the box", but "inside the box". Much learning is spent on memorizing while "in the box" but in my experience, real learning stems from not remembering how to do something, but from knowing how to do something.
